Environmental Sound Classification Deep CNN models forÂ the Classification of Environmental Sounds from various common sounds.
For my project, I used ESC-10, which contains 400 recordings of 10 classes (dog bark, rain, sea waves, baby cry, clock tick, person sneeze, helicopter, chainsaw, rooster, and fire crackling), which is subsequent to ESC50. Each class has 40 recordings, and each recording is 5 seconds long.
